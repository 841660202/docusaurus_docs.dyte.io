# Room Connection Events

The `meeting` object emits various events for indicating changes in the connection state of the room.
Whenever there is a connection drop, the Dyte SDK detects it and tries to reconnect the user to the meeting room automatically.

## Events

You can subscribe to these events by implementing the below given callbacks from
`DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener` and passing the object to
`meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(dyteMeetingRoomEventsListener)`.

### Connecting to room

Triggered when the local user starts connecting to the meeting room during initialization.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onConnectingToMeetingRoom() {
      super.onConnectingToMeetingRoom()
    }
});
```

### Connected to room

Triggered when the local user connects to the meeting room after initialization.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onConnectedToMeetingRoom() {
      super.onConnectedToMeetingRoom()
    }
});
```

### Disconnected from room

Triggered when the local user disconnects while leaving the the meeting room.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onDisconnectedFromMeetingRoom() {
      super.onDisconnectedFromMeetingRoom()
    }
});
```

### Reconnecting to room

Triggered when the Dyte SDK detects a connection drop and starts trying reconnection with the meeting room.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onReconnectingToMeetingRoom() {
      super.onReconnectingToMeetingRoom()
    }
});
```

### Reconnected to room

Triggered when the local user successfully reconnects to the meeting room.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onReconnectedToMeetingRoom() {
      super.onReconnectedToMeetingRoom()
    }
});
```

### Room connection failed

Triggered when the local user fails to connect to the meeting room during initialization. This can happen due to internet connection issues.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRoomConnectionFailed() {
      super.onMeetingRoomConnectionFailed()
    }
});
```

### Room reconnection failed

Triggered when the local user fails to reconnect to the meeting room. This will happen the local user's 
internet connection is down for a considerably long duration and the Dyte SDK is unable to reconnect even after multiple attempts.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRoomReconnectionFailed() {
      super.onMeetingRoomReconnectionFailed()
    }
});
```
