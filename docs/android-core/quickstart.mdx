# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.

:::

The DyteMobileClient is the main class of the SDK. It is the main entry point of
the SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order to use the
SDK. To instantiate DyteMobileClient, you should use
`DyteAndroidClientBuilder.build(activity)` and pass your activity instance
there.

```kotlin
val meeting = DyteAndroidClientBuilder.build(activity);
```

Now you can use `meeting` to join in the room. First step is to establish a
connection to the meeting server, you can do that with

```kotlin
val meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfo(
    roomName = MEETING_ROOM_NAME,
    authToken = AUTH_TOKEN
)
meeting.init(meetingInfo)
```

You can get the `roomName` and `authToken` using our backend APIs. Please refer
[for room name](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/create_meeting) &
[for auth token](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/add_participant)

:::info Init meeting event listeners Once you call `init()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering observer as follows.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingInitStarted() {
      super.onMeetingInitStarted()
      // on meeting init started
    }

    override fun onMeetingInitCompleted() {
      super.onMeetingInitCompleted()
      // on meeting init completed
    }

    override fun onMeetingInitFailed(exception: Exception) {
      super.onMeetingInitFailed(exception)
      // on meeting init failed
    }
  })
```

:::

Now to join in the room, use

```kotlin
meeting.joinRoom()
```

:::info Join room event listeners Once you call `joinRoom()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering observer as follows.

```kotlin
meeting.addSelfEventsListener(object : DyteSelfEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRoomJoinStarted() {
      super.onMeetingRoomJoinStarted()
      // meeting join started
    }

    override fun onMeetingRoomJoined() {
      super.onMeetingRoomJoined()
      // meeting room joined succesfully
    }

    override fun onMeetingRoomJoinFailed(exception: Exception) {
      super.onMeetingRoomJoinFailed(exception)
      // error in joining meeting room.
    }
  })
```

:::

And voila, you just joined a room with Dyte's mobile SDK.

Similarely to leave the meeting you can call `leaveRoom()` on `meeting` object.

```kotlin
meeting.leaveRoom()
```

:::info Leave room event listeners You can listen to `leaveRoom()` callbacks by
registering obsever on meeting object as follows

```kotlin
meeting.addSelfEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted() {
      super.onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted()
      // meeting room leave started
    }

    override fun onMeetingRoomLeft() {
      super.onMeetingRoomLeft()
      // meeting room leave completed
    }
  })
```
