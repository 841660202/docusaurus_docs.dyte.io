# Installation

1. In your project, add the Maven repository `https://maven.dyte.in`. The repository typically goes into the `build.gradle` file in the root of your project.

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven {
            url "https://maven.dyte.in"
        }
    }
}
```

2. Add the dependency `com.dyteclientmobile:sdk`. Dependency definitions belong in the individual module `build.gradle` files.

```groovy
dependencies {
    // (other dependencies)
    implementation "com.dyteclientmobile:sdk:+"
    // optionally if you app does not have support libraries
    implementation 'androidx.localbroadcastmanager:localbroadcastmanager:1.0.0'
}
```

:::info

The below instructions are for the release builds, debug builds should work without any additional steps.

:::

1. Create / append to the file `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`

```groovy
-keep class org.webrtc.** { *; }
```

3. In your `android/app/build.gradle` edit the release configuration and add the following line importing the proguard configuration

```groovy
buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
            ...
            ...
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
```

## Configure the meeting connection

You need to pass a [`DyteUIKitConfig`](./reference/dyte-ui-kit-config) to [`DyteUIKitBuilder`](./reference/dyte-ui-kit-builder) to define which meeting should the client connect to and a couple of other setup parameters, out of which only `authToken` and `roomName` are mandatory.

`DyteUIKitBuilder` is a static class and can be used to control and observe the meeting from anywhere in your application.
