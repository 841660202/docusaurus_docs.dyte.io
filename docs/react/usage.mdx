# Basic Usage

## Include Dyte's React component in your app

`DyteMeeting` is a React component that can be included in your React application to show the Dyte Meeting UI.

It has 3 mandatory and 2 optional props, which are defined below along with their usage.

### Get meeting instance on successful creation

You need to pass an `onInit` prop to `DyteMeeting` to get reference to the meeting instance that is created. `onInit` expects a function which has a single param of type `Meeting` and is not expected to return anything. This `Meeting` reference can be used to take further actions and make customizations to the meeting.

```jsx {2}
<DyteMeeting
    onInit={(meeting) => { }}
    >
```

### Pass Client ID for verification

You need to pass a `clientId` prop to `DyteMeeting` to verify the participant's `authToken` against.

```jsx {3}
<DyteMeeting
    onInit={(meeting) => { }}
    clientId=`yourClientID`
    >
```

### Configure the meeting connection

You need to pass a `meetingConfig` prop to `DyteMeeting` to define which meeting should the client connect to and a couple of other setup parameters, out of which only `authToken` and `roomName` are mandatory.

```jsx {4-7}
<DyteMeeting
    onInit={(meeting) => { }}
    clientId=`yourClientID`
    meetingConfig={{
        roomName: `roomName`,
        authToken: `authToken`
    }}
    >
```
