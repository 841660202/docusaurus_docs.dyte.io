# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.

:::

The DyteMobileClient is the main class of the SDK. It is the main entry point of the SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order to use the SDK. To instantiate DyteMobileClient, you should use `DyteiOSClientBuilder().build()` and pass your activity instance there.:

```swift
val meeting = DyteiOSClientBuilder().build()
```
Add listeners and implement callback stubs

```swift
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(meetingRoomEventsListener: self)
meeting.addParticipantEventsListener(participantEventsListener: self)
meeting.addSelfEventsListener(selfEventsListener: self)
```

Now you can use `meeting` to join in the room.
First step is to establish a connection to the meeting server, you can do that with 

```swift
let meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfo(roomName: meetingText,
                                          authToken: authToken,
                                          enableAudio: true,
                                          enableVideo: true,
                                          baseUrl: Constants.BASE_URL)

meeting.doInit(dyteMeetingInfo: meetingInfo)
```

`baseUrl` can be found at [Dyte developer portal](https://dev.dyte.in/).
You can get the `roomName` and `authToken` using our backend APIs. Please refer [this for room name](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/createMeeting) & [this for auth token](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/addParticipant)


after `onMeetingInitCompleted()` Now to join in the room, use 

```swift
meeting.joinRoom()
```

:::info Join room event listeners 
Once you call `joinRoom()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering observer as follows.
:::

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    func onMeetingRoomJoinStarted() {
        // meeting join started
    }

    func onMeetingRoomJoined() {
        // meeting room joined succesfully
    }

    func onMeetingRoomJoinFailed(exception: KotlinException) {
        // error in joining meeting room.
    }
  }
```

And voila, you just joined a room with Dyte's mobile SDK.

Similarely to leave the meeting you can call `leaveRoom()` on `meeting` object.

```swift
meeting.leaveRoom()
```

:::info Leave room event listeners 
You can listen to `leaveRoom()` callbacks by
registering obsever on meeting object as follows
:::

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted() {
        // meeting room leave started    
    }
    
    func onMeetingRoomLeft() {
        // meeting room leave completed
    }      
}
```
