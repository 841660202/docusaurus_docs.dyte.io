# iOS Core SDK Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to use Dyte's iOS Core SDK to add live video and audio
to your iOS applications.

For getting started quickly, you can use our
[sample code](https://github.com/dyte-in/mobile-core-sample-ios). You can clone
and run a sample application from the
[iOS Core SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyte-in/mobile-core-sample-ios).

## Objective

You’ll learn how to:

- Install the Dyte SDK
- Initialize the SDK
- Configure a Dyte meeting
- Initialize the Dyte meeting
- And go live with your Dyte meeting

## Before Getting Started

- Make sure you've read the
  [Getting Started with Dyte](https://docs.dyte.io/getting-started) topic and
  completed the steps in the
  [Integrate Dyte](https://docs.dyte.io/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.
  You must complete the following steps:
  - Create a [Dyte Developer Account](https://dev.dyte.io/)
  - Create [Presets](https://dev.dyte.io/roles-presets)
  - Create a
    [Dyte Meeting](https://docs.dyte.io/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
  - [Add Participant](https://docs.dyte.io/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant)
    to the meeting
- Install
  [Xcode](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwin55bqodH8AhUVQXwKHaR-DAsQFnoECA0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fxcode%2Fid497799835%3Fmt%3D12&usg=AOvVaw2fEvMbfRtGhB4SPHYB54NX)
- Ensure that Rosetta is installed with Xcode on Mac computers with Apple
  silicon.
- Make sure your Mac computers are running macOS version 12.0 Monterey or
  higher.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

:::tip iOS minimum version 12.0

Set your platform to iOS 12.0 or above in your Podfile.

:::

1. Add 'DyteiOSCore' to your Podfile.

```ruby
pod 'DyteiOSCore'
```

2. Install the client SDK from pod.

```shell
pod install
```

3. Add the following entries to the info.plist file. This gives permission to
   your app to access the camera and microphone, access photos, install the
   required fonts and icons. - the strings are displayed in the permission
   pop-ups, feel free to customize them to suit your audience

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will use your Bluetooth to access your Bluetooth headphones.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will use your Bluetooth to access your Bluetooth headphones.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to see you during meetings, we need access to your camera.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to hear you during meetings, we need access to your microphone.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to share, we need access to your photos.</string>
<false/>
```

:::tip Note

If you intend to publish your app to the App Store, you'll need to perform a few
additional steps. So if you’re working on release build and not debug builds,
refer to the [Release Builds](#for-ios-release-builds) section.

:::

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK

1. The `DyteMobileClient` is the main class of the SDK. It is the main entry
   point of the SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order
   to use the SDK. To instantiate DyteMobileClient, you should use
   `DyteiOSClientBuilder().build()`.
=======
## Step 2: Initialize the SDK

The `DyteMobileClient` is the main class of the SDK. It is the main entry point
of the SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order to use
the SDK. To instantiate DyteMobileClient, you should use
`DyteiOSClientBuilder().build()`.
>>>>>>> main

```swift
let meeting = DyteiOSClientBuilder().build()
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Add listeners and implement callback stubs
=======
Add listeners and implement callback stubs
>>>>>>> main

```swift
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(meetingRoomEventsListener: self)
meeting.addParticipantEventsListener(participantEventsListener: self)
meeting.addSelfEventsListener(selfEventsListener: self)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Step 3: Set the properties in the DyteMeetingInfo class.

If you're using v1 APIs, then you need to pass the roonName and authToken. For
v2, you just need to provide the participant's authToken.
=======
Now you can use `meeting` to join in the room. First step is to establish a
connection to the meeting server, you can do that with
>>>>>>> main

You can get the `roomName` and `authToken` using our backend APIs. Please refer
[this for room name](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/createMeeting) &
[this for auth token](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/addParticipant)

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken` | After you've created the meeting, <br/> add each participant to the meeting <br/> using the [Add Participant API](https://docs.dyte.io/api?v=v2#/operations/add_participant)<br/> (The presetName created earlier <br/> must be passed in the body <br/> of the Add Participant API request) <br/> The API response contains the `authToken`. |
=======
You can get the `roomName` and `authToken` using our backend APIs. Please refer
[this for room name](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/createMeeting) &
[this for auth token](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/addParticipant)
>>>>>>> main

For V1 APIs:

```swift
let meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfo(authToken: authToken,
                                          roomName: meetingText,
                                          enableAudio: true,
                                          enableVideo: true)

```

<<<<<<< HEAD
For V2 APIs:
=======
For V2 APIs: (Note: roomName is not required for v2 APIs)
>>>>>>> main

```swift
let meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfo(authToken: authToken,
                                          enableAudio: true,
                                          enableVideo: true)

```

## Step 4: Initialize the connection request.

To initialize the connection request, call the `doInit()` method obtained on
`meeting` with the `meetingInfo` argument. This will establish the connection
with the Dyte meeting server.

Now you can use `meeting` to join in the room. First step is to establish a
connection to the meeting server, you can do that with `doInit`

For V1 APIs:

```swift
meeting.doInit(dyteMeetingInfo: meetingInfo)
```

For V2 APIs:

```swift
dyteMobileClient?.doInit(dyteMeetingInfo_: meetingInfo)
```

## Step 5: Connect to the meeting

<<<<<<< HEAD
Now, you have established the connection with the Dyte meeting server
successfully. Once `onMeetingInitCompleted()` is triggered, next step is to join
the room.
=======
after `onMeetingInitCompleted()` Now to join in the room, use
>>>>>>> main

```swift
meeting.joinRoom()
```

:::info Join room event listeners Once you call `joinRoom()`, you can listen to
<<<<<<< HEAD
callbacks for this action on meeting object if you have done
`meeting.addSelfEventsListener(selfEventsListener: self)`. :::
=======
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering observer. :::
>>>>>>> main

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onMeetingRoomJoinStarted() {
        // meeting join started
    }

    func onMeetingRoomJoined() {
        // meeting room joined succesfully
    }

    func onMeetingRoomJoinFailed(exception: KotlinException) {
        // error in joining meeting room.
    }
  }
```

And voila, you just joined a room with Dyte's mobile SDK.

### Leave the room

Once the meeting is over, you can leave the meeting room.

To leave the meeting you can call `leaveRoom()` on `meeting` object.

```swift
meeting.leaveRoom()
```

:::info Leave room event listeners You can listen to `leaveRoom()` callbacks by
registering obsever on meeting object as follows :::

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted() {
        // meeting room leave started
    }

    func onMeetingRoomLeft() {
        // meeting room leave completed
    }
}
```

## For iOS release builds

Disable `BITCODE` in your Podfile.

```dart
post_install do |installer|
   installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
       target.build_configurations.each do |config|
           config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
       end
   end
end
```
