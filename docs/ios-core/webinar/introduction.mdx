# Introducing webinar

The webinar object is stored in `meeting.webinar`, which has methods for
stage management and participant management. There are methods to join stage, leave stage and do access control for particiapants.

The `meeting.webinar.viewers` array contains all the viewers that have joined the webinar.
The `meeting.webinar.requestedParticipants` array contains all the present requests from participants who wants to join the stage.

## Join stage

User with permission to join stage can start presting in a webinar.
There are two flows here. For participants with media preset set to ALLOWED can join without host accepting their request.
For participants with media preset set to Need to Request, will have to wait for the host to accept their request and once host accepts they can start producing media.

:::tip Note

:::

```kotlin
meeting.webinar.joinStage()
```

## Leave stage

User can leave stage as follows.

```kotlin

```

## Host requests a participant to join stage.

When host requests a participant to join stage, the user will get a callback in `DyteWebinarEventsListener#onPresentRequestReceived()` and then user has to accept the request by calling

```kotlin
meeting.webinar.acceptRequestToPresent()
```

or can decline the request by calling 
```kotlin
meeting.webinar.rejectRequestToPresent()
```
