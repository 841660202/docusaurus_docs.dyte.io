# Stage management in webinar

Participant with accept requests set as true in their preset can do stage management in the webinar.

To access the list of requests received to join stage, one can use `meeting.webinar.requestedParticipants` api.

To accept a request you need to call `meeting.webinar.acceptRequest(id)` and to reject one can call `meeting.webinar.rejectRequest(id)`
If the participant does not have permission to perform above operations the SDK will throw `UnsupportedOperationException`.

To listen to request coming in once you are in the meeting one can register a listener in `meeting` object as follows:

```kotlin
    meeting.addWebinarEventsListener(object : DyteWebinarEventsListener {
    override fun onPresentRequestReceived() {
      // when host requests this user to join stage. Here one should give choice to either accept the request or decline it.
    }

    override fun onAddedToStage() {
      // when this user is joined to stage
    }

    override fun onRemovedFromStage() {
      // when this user is no longer on stage
    }

    override fun onPresetRequestAdded(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
      // when a user is requesting to join the stage
    }

    override fun onPresentRequestClosed(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
      // when a user who was trying to join stage leaves the call.
    }

    override fun onPresetRequestAccepted(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
      // when a join stage request is accepted by host
    }

    override fun onPresetRequestRejected(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
      // when a join stage request is denied by host
    }

    override fun onPresetRequestWithdrawn(participant: RequestToPresentParticipant) {
      // when a user who was trying to join stage withdraws their request to join.
    }
  })
```

## Accepting stage requests

Participant with accept request set as true in their preset can accept requests as follows

```kotlin
meeting.webinar.acceptRequest(id)
meeting.webinar.acceptAllRequest()
```

## Rejecting stage requests

Participant with accept request set as true in their preset can reject requests as follows

```kotlin
meeting.webinar.rejectRequest(id)
meeting.webinar.rejectAllRequest()
```
