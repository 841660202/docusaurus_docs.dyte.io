# Introduction - Participants

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `participants`
objects of `DyteMobileClient()` provider. To get all the objects and methods
related to participants:

```dart
  final participants = ref.watch(dyteClient).particiants;
```

Use the methods and events to consume the participants data. For example, to get
all the participants who joined the meeting:

```dart
// get all joined participants
final joinedParticipants = ref.watch(dyteClient).participants.joined;
```

The `ref.watch(dyteClient).participants` object has the following properties.

- `waitlisted`: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the
  meeting.
- `joined`: A list that contains all the participants who have joined the
  meeting.
- `active`: A list that contains all the participants except the local user who
  are supposed to be on the screen at the moment
- `screenshares`: A list that contains all the participants who have shared
  screen in the meeting.
- `pinned`: Pinned participant of the meeting.

Therefore, if you were to make a grid of participants, you'd use the `active`
list, but to display all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined`
list.

Each participant in each of the `joined`, `waitlisted`, `active`, `pinned` and
`screenshares` list is of type `DyteMeetingParticipant`.

You can subscribe to various events on the participants by implementing
`DyteParticipantEventsListener` and passing the object to

```dart
ref.watch(dyteClient).addParticipantEventsListener(dyteParticipantEventsListener);
```

## Grid info for the room

`DyteGridPagesInfo` object is intended for pagination. It is returned with
`ParticipantEventStates.onParticipantsUpdated` state.

```dart {6}
    ref.listen<ParticipantEventStates>(participantEventStateNotifierProvider,
      (_, next) {
        next.maybeMap(
          onParticipantsUpdated: (res) {
            ...
            _gridPagesInfo = res.gridPagesInfo;
            ...
          },
          orElse: () => print("ORELSE STATE")
      }
```

It contains the following properties:

- `currentPageNumber`: Int, returns the current page number (currently displayed
  by the client).
- `pageCount`: Int, max pages possible with current number of participants.
- `isNextPagePossible`: bool, if the next page of participants is available.
- `isPreviousPagePossible`: bool, if previous page of participants is available.
- `shouldShowPaginator`: bool, to show the paginator or not.

## Move between pages in paginated mode

The `setPage(int pageNumber)` method allows you to switch between pages of
participants present in the meeting. It will set the active participants list to
participants on `pageNumber` page, and participant list is returned with
`ParticipantEventStates.onParticipantsUpdated` state.

```dart {6}
    ref.listen<ParticipantEventStates>(participantEventStateNotifierProvider,
      (_, next) {
        next.maybeMap(
          onParticipantsUpdated: (res) {
            ...
            _activeParticipants = res.participants.active;
            ...
          },
          orElse: () => print("ORELSE STATE")
      }
```

## Video update for all participants

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo` or
`disableVideo`

```dart

void videoUpdate(bool videoEnabled) {
  if (videoEnabled) {
      // video is enabled, and other participants in room can see local user
    } else {
      // video is disabled, and other participants in room can not see local user.
    }
}

```

## Audio update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio` or
`disableAudio`

```dart

void audioUpdate({
  required bool audioEnabled,
  required DyteMeetingParticipant participant,
}) {
    if (audioEnabled) {
      // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
    } else {
      // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
    }
}

```

There are some other callbacks which we are'nt using in flutter frontend, what
to do with them?
