# Local User - Events

You can subscribe to various local user events. For subscribing:

- Implement `DyteSelfEventsListener` to a class say `LocalUserListener`, and
  listen to event from `DyteSelfEventsListener` by overriding them. This class
  can be user to manage your state in the application.

```dart
class LocalUserListener with DyteSelfEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onAudioDevicesUpdated() {
    /// code to handle onAudioDevicesUpdated() event
  }

  ...
}
```

- Now to subscribe, pass the instance of `LocalUserListener` class created above
  to `addSelfEventsListener()` method of `dyteClient` instance as follows:

```dart {2}
dyteClient.addSelfEventsListener(
  // LocalUserListener class instance
);
```

### Video update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo` or
`disableVideo`

```dart
@override
void onVideoUpdate(bool videoEnabled) {
  if(isVideoEnabled){
    // Video is enabled, other users can see the video.
  } else {
    // Video is disabled, others users can't see the video.
  }

  //  or alternatively you can pass the bool through state as demonstrated in example app.
}
```

### Audio update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio` or
`disableAudio`

```dart
@override
void onAudioUpdate(bool audioEnabled) {
  if (audioEnabled) {
      // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
    } else {
      // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
    }

  //  or alternatively you can pass the bool through state as demonstrated in example app.
}
```

### Room disconnected update

Triggered when the user is disconnected due to media/network errors

```dart

@override
void onMeetingRoomDisconnected() {
  // show alert to user that he is disconnected from the meeting
}
```

### Proximity changed

Triggered when there is any change in proximity. Meaning if device is near ear
piece which triggers display on/off.

```dart

@override
void onProximityChanged(bool isNear) {
  // isNear
  // if true, display should be turned off, as user might be speaking through earpience
  // if false, display should be tunred on, as user might be looking at display and listening through speaker/earphones.
}

```

### Waitlist status

For meetings whose waiting room is enabled:
Developers can listen to those changes in `onWaitListStatusUpdate()` callbacks

```dart
@override
void onWaitListStatusUpdate(WaitListStatus waitListStatus) {
  // waitListStatus
  // if true, user is in waitlist
  // if false, user is not in waitlist
}
```

## Webinar Request

Whenever local user recieves the request to join the webinar, `onWebinarPresentRequestReceived()` callback is triggered and `onStoppedPresenting()` callback is triggered when the local user stops presenting.

```dart
@override
void onWebinarPresentRequestReceived() {
  // show alert to user to accept or reject the request
}

@override
void onStoppedPresenting() {
  // show alert to user that he is no longer presenting
}
```

## LocalUser removed

Whenever local user is removed from the meeting, `onRemovedFromMeeting()` callback is triggered.

```dart

@override
void onRemovedFromMeeting() {
  // show alert to user that he is no longer in the meeting
}
```
