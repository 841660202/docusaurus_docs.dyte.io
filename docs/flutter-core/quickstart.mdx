# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.

:::

The `DyteMobileClient` is the main class of the SDK. It is the main entry point
and the ONLY class required to instantiate Dyte SDK.

```dart
final dyteClient = DyteMobileClient();
```

First step is to establish a connection to the meeting server with set default
properties. Properties can be set with `DyteMeetingInfo` class. To initialize
the connection request, call the `init()` method on obtained `dyteClient`
instance with `meetingInfo` argument as follows:

```dart
final meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfo(
                    roomName: "<room_name>",
                    authToken: '<auth_token>',
                  );

dyteClient.init(meetingInfo)
```

Kindly refer to links below to get corresponding arguments:  
`baseUrl`: [Dyte developer portal](https://dev.dyte.in/).  
`roomName`:
[this for `roomName`](https://docs.dyte.io/api/#/operations/create_meeting)  
`authToken`:
[this for `authToken`](https://docs.dyte.io/api/#/operations/add_participant).

:::info

Init meeting event listeners Once you call `init()`, you can listen to callbacks
for this action on meeting object by registering state observers as follows.

:::

```dart
class RoomStateNotifier with DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onMeetingInitStarted() {
    /// on meeting init started
  }

  override
  void onMeetingInitCompleted() {
    /// on meeting init completed
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingInitFailed(Exception exception) {
    /// on meeting init failed
  }

  ...
}

```

Now, you have established the connection with Dyte meeting server succesfully.
Next step is to join the room.  
To join, call `joinRoom()` method on `dyteClient` instance as shown below.

```dart
dyteClient.joinRoom();
```

:::info

Join room event listeners Once you call `joinRoom()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering state observers as
follows.

:::

```dart

class LocalUserStatesNotifier with DyteSelfEventsListener {

  @override
  onMeetingRoomJoinStarted() {
    /// Handle join start state
  }

  @override
  onMeetingRoomJoined: () {
    /// Handle joining completion, ex: move to room screen
  },

  @override
  onMeetingRoomJoinFailed: (exception){
    /// Handle failure
  },
}

```

Now to leave, call `leaveRoom()` method on `dyteClient` instance as shown below.

```dart
dyteClient.leaveRoom()
```

:::info

Leave room event listeners You can listen to `leaveRoom()` callbacks by
registering state obsever on meeting object as follows

:::

```dart
class RoomStateNotifier with DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted() {
    /// on meeting room leave started
  }

  @override
  void onMeetingRoomLeft() {
    /// on meeting room left
  }

  ...

}

```

Congratulations! You've successfully joined the room.
