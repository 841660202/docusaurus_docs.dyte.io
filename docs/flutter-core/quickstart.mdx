# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.

:::

The `DyteMobileClient` is the main class of the SDK. It is the main entry point
and the ONLY class required to instantiate Dyte SDK.

In our case, we are using `Riverpod` state management. Hence, we create a
provider for `DyteMobileClient` as shown below:

```dart
final dyteClient = Provider((ref) => DyteMobileClient());
```

First step is to establish a connection to the meeting server with set default
properties. Properties can be set with `DyteMeetingInfo` class. To initialize
the connection request, call the `init()` method on obtained `dyteClient`
provider with `meetingInfo` argument as follows:

_Note: We obtain the provider in Riverpod by `ref.watch(providerName)` method.
For more info: refer [here](https://riverpod.dev/docs/concepts/reading)_

```dart
final meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfo(
                    roomName: "<room_name>",
                    enableAudio: true,
                    displayName: 'Flutter core',
                    authToken: '<auth_token>',
                  );

ref.watch(dyteClient).init(meetingInfo)
```

Kindly refer to links below to get corresponding arguments:  
`baseUrl`: [Dyte developer portal](https://dev.dyte.in/).  
`roomName`:
[this for `roomName`](https://docs.dyte.io/api/#/operations/create_meeting)  
`authToken`:
[this for `authToken`](https://docs.dyte.io/api/#/operations/add_participant).

:::info Init meeting event listeners Once you call `init()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering state observers as
follows. 
:::

```dart
  ref.listen<RoomEventStates>(roomEventStateNotifierProvider, (_, next) {
    next.maybeWhen(
      onMeetingInitStarted: () {
        /// Handle init starting process
      },
  
      onMeetingInitCompleted: () {
        /// Handle Meeting init complete, ex: move to next page
      },
      
      onMeetingInitFailed: (exception){
        /// Handle failure
      },
      orElse: () {},
    );
  });
```

Now, you have established the connection with Dyte meeting server succesfully.
Next step is to join the room.  
To join, call `joinRoom()` method on `dyteClient` provider as shown below.

```dart
ref.watch(dyteClient).joinRoom();
```

:::info Join room event listeners Once you call `joinRoom()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering state observers as
follows. 
:::

```dart
ref.listen<LocalUserEventStates>(localUserProvider, (previous, next) {
  next.maybeWhen(
    onMeetingRoomJoinStarted: () {
      /// Handle join start state
    },

    onMeetingRoomJoined: () {
      /// Handle joining completion, ex: move to room screen
    },

    onMeetingRoomJoinFailed: (exception){
      /// Handle failure
    },
  
    orElse: () {},
  );
});
```

:::info Leave room event listeners You can listen to `leaveRoom()` callbacks by
registering state obsever on meeting object as follows 
:::

```dart
ref.listen<RoomEventStates>(roomEventStateNotifierProvider,
    (previous, next) {
  next.maybeMap(
    onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted: (_){
      /// Handle leaving starting process
    },

    onMeetingRoomLeft: (_) {
      /// Handle meeting room left, ex: move out to home screen
    },
    
    orElse: () {},
  );
});
```

Congratulations! You've successfully joined the room.
