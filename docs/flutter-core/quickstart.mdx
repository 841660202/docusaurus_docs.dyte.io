# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.

:::

The `DyteMobileClient` is the main class of the SDK. It is the main entry point
and the ONLY class required to instantiate Dyte SDK.

In our case, we are using `Riverpod` state management. Hence, we create a
provider for `DyteMobileClient` as shown below:

```dart
final dyteClient = Provider((ref) => DyteMobileClient());
```

First step is to establish a connection to the meeting server with set default
properties. Properties can be set with `DyteMeetingInfo` class. To initialize
the connection request, call the `init()` method on obtained `dyteClient`
provider with `meetingInfo` argument as follows:

_Note: We obtain the provider in Riverpod by `ref.watch(providerName)` method.
For more info: refer [here](https://riverpod.dev/docs/concepts/reading)_

```dart
final meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfo(
                    roomName: "<room_name>",
                    enableAudio: true,
                    displayName: 'Flutter core',
                    authToken: '<auth_token>',
                    orgId: "<org_id>",
                  );

ref.watch(dyteClient).init(meetingInfo)
```

Kindly refer to links below to get corresponding arguments:  
`baseUrl`: [Dyte developer portal](https://dev.dyte.in/).  
`roomName`:
[this for `roomName`](https://docs.dyte.io/api/#/operations/create_meeting)  
`authToken`:
[this for `authToken`](https://docs.dyte.io/api/#/operations/add_participant).

:::info Init meeting event listeners Once you call `init()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering state observers as
follows. :::

```dart
    ref.listen<RoomEventStates>(roomEventStateNotifierProvider, (_, next) {
      next.maybeWhen(
        onMeetingInitFailed: (exception) =>
            log("MEETING INIT FAILED EXCEPTION: ${exception.toString()}"),
        onMeetingInitStarted: () => log("MEETING INIT STARTED!!"),
        onMeetingInitCompleted: () {
          Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) {
            return const StagingRoom();
          }));
        },
        orElse: () {},
      );
    });
```

Now, you have established the connection with Dyte meeting server succesfully.
Next step is to join the room.  
To join, call `joinRoom()` method on `dyteClient` provider as shown below.

```dart
ref.watch(dyteClient).joinRoom();
```

:::info Join room event listeners Once you call `joinRoom()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object by registering state observers as
follows. :::

```dart
    ref.listen<LocalUserEventStates>(localUserProvider, (previous, next) {
      next.maybeWhen(
        onMeetingRoomJoinStarted: () => log("MEET ROOM JOINING"),
        onMeetingRoomJoinFailed: (exception) =>
            log("MEET ROOM JOINING FAILED WITH EXCEPTION: $exception"),
        onMeetingRoomDisconnected: () => log("MEETING ROOM DISCONNECTED"),
        onMeetingRoomJoined: () {
          Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) {
            return const DyteRoom();
          }));
        },
        orElse: () {},
      );
    });
```

:::info Leave room event listeners You can listen to `leaveRoom()` callbacks by
registering state obsever on meeting object as follows :::

```dart
    ref.listen<RoomEventStates>(roomEventStateNotifierProvider,
        (previous, next) {
      next.maybeMap(
        onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted: (value) => log("LEAVING ROOM..."),
        onMeetingRoomLeft: (value) => Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil(
          context,
          MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => const HomePage(),
          ),
          (route) => false,
        ),
        orElse: () {},
      );
    });
```

Congratulations! You've successfully joined the room.
