# Receiving chat messages

To listen for chat messages you need to implement
`onChatUpdates()` method from callback `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`ref.watch(dyteClient).addMeetingEventsListener(dyteMeetingRoomEventsListener)`

```dart
@override
void onChatUpdates(
        newMessage: Boolean,
        message: DyteChatMessage?,
        messages: List<DyteChatMessage>
      ) {
        // your code to handle new chat message
      }
```

Here, the `message` is of type `DyteChatMessage`, as defined in
[introduction](./introduction). `messages` is a list of all chat messages in the
meeting, which is the same as `ref.watch(dyteClient).chat.messages`.

When a chat message is received, the `ref.watch(dyteClient).chat.messages` list is also
updated.
