# Receiving chat messages

To listen for chat messages you need to implement `onChatUpdates()` method from
callback `DyteChatEventsListener`. You can subscribe to this events by
calling

```dart

class ChatEventsListener with DyteChatEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onChatUpdates(List<DyteChatMessage> messages) {
        // your code to handle new chat message
  }

  void onNewChatMessage(DyteChatMessage message) {
      // your code to handle new chat message
  }
  ...
}
```

```dart
dyteClient.addMeetingEventsListener(
  /// ChatEventsListener instance
)
```

Here, the `message` is of type `DyteChatMessage`, as defined in
[introduction](./introduction). `messages` is a list of all chat messages in the
meeting, which is the same as `dyteClient.chat.messages`.

When a chat message is received, the `dyteClient.chat.messages` list is also
updated.
