# Recording

The `ref.watch(dyteClient).recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a meeting. 

To get the current status of the recording, you need to listen for `onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated()` event.
This returns `DyteRecordingStatus` object with it.

There can be 4 states:
- `idle`
- `starting`
- `recording`
- `stopping`

## Start a recording
To start a recording, you need to call the `start()` method in the `ref.watch(dyteClient).recording` object, as shown below.

```dart
ref.watch(dyteClient).recording.start();
```

## Stop a recording
To stop a recording, you need to call the `stop()` method in the `ref.watch(dyteClient).recording` object, as shown below.

```dart
ref.watch(dyteClient).recording.stop();
```

## Listen to recording state changes

The changes to recording state can be listened by implementing 
`onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated` from `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`. 
You can attach this observer by calling `ref.watch(dyteClient).addMeetingRoomEventsListener(listener)`.

```dart
ref.listen<RoomEventStates>(roomEventStateNotifierProvider,
    (previous, next) {
  next.maybeMap(
    onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated: (res) {
      // You can access the updated recording state by calling `res.recordingState`
    },
  );
});
```
