Dyte's live video platform allows you to build real-time communication functionality into your web, and mobile applications. It is built on top of [WebRTC](https://dyte.io/blog/webrtc/). Using Dyte's REST APIs and client-side SDKs, you can acquire, transmit and play media, and manage network connections in your applications.

Dyte provides a range of features including group calls, webinars, interactive live streaming, breakout rooms, plugins, auto bandwidth switching, detailed call analytics, and more.

## Components of a Dyte live video application

Dyte requires both frontend and a backend component. In addition to backend APIs and frontend SDKs, it is also requires access to Dyte's [developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io/dashboard).

### Backend HTTP REST APIs

Your backend utilizes Dyte REST APIs to perform actions such as:

- [Create meetings](/api#/operations/create_meeting)
- [Add participants to a meeting](/api#/operations/add_participant)
- [Start recording a meeting](/api#/operations/start_recording) and so on

### Frontend SDKs

Your applications bundle Dyte Core SDKs (and UI Kits) to acquire, transmit and play media, and manage network connections.

#### Core SDK

The Dyte Core SDK is designed to provide developers with an easy way to incorporate real-time communication (RTC) solutions into their apps and websites. With full customization and branding options, you can build your own user interface from the ground up without dealing with complicated media layers.

The Core SDK acts as a data-only layer, offering high-level primitives and abstracting away complex media and networking optimizations. It only provides simple APIs that are user-friendly and easy to work with. For more information, see [Introduction to Core SDK](/web-core/Introduction).

#### UI Kit

Dyte's UI Kit is a prebuilt design library of UI components designed to simplify the integration of video and voice calls into your app or website. It is build on top of the core SDKs, which handle all the low-level media and network handling parts of a meeting and exposes simpler APIs to use. By using the web-core components and passing them to the UI Kit, you can easily create and customize meeting experiences. For more information, see [UI Kit](/react-ui-kit).

### Developer portal

The [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/dashboard) serves as a comprehensive platform, offering access to meeting logs, API key management, billing operations, and various other functionalities in one place.

## Advanced features of Dyte's live video meetings

Dyte's live video application also provides the following advanced features:

### Virtual background

You can add custom virtual background to Dyte video calls. You can add background to any of our supported web applications, React, Angular, JavaScript, and so on including UI Kit and core SDKs. For more information, see [Add Custom Virtual Background to Dyte meetings](/guides/customization/add-virtual-background).

### Transcription

You can integrate Google Speech-to-Text (STT) into Dyte meetings to add audio transcriptions. This third-party service accurately transcribes participants' spoken audio in real-time. By leveraging Google Translate, the transcriptions can be easily translated into individual participants' desired languages. For more information, see [Add Audio Transcriptions to Video Meetings](https://dyte.io/blog/audio-transcriptions-video-meeting/).

### Custom filters

Dyte SDKs provide flexibility not just in terms of the UI but in terms of media as well. You can build your own audio/video filters, similar to Snapchat or Talking Tom filters, to add fun effects like retro styles, birthday themes, funny hats, or even a Darth Vader voice, creating engaging and unique experiences for participants. For more information, see [Add Exciting Custom Filters to Video Calls with Dyte](https://dyte.io/blog/streams-blog/).

### Customize participant feeds to display your branding

In scenarios like multi-company conferences and developer conferences, the standard branding at the top left of the meeting UI may not be relevant. To indicate the company each participant represents, you may prefer to display branding per participant. Dyte offers simple media add-ons to support this use case effectively.

### Include countdown timer

For time-sensitive appointments like doctor-patient consultations, one-on-one horoscope readings, and paid sessions that are billed per minute or hour, it is beneficial for participants to see the remaining time to make the most of their meetings. Dyte provides a middleware that allows you to seamlessly add a timer directly to the video feed.
