### Meeting

A communication channel created on Dyte is termed as a `meeting`.

### Participants

Anyone who joins the `meeting`, whether as an actual user or a machine user

### Permission

A specific action allowed or not for a `participant`.

### Preset

A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that are applied to
participants. The presets define how the meeting will look, feel, and behave for
the participants.

- You can create presets for the Group Call and Webinar meeting type.
- You can set the maximum number of people on screen, the maximum number of
  people sharing the screen, provide permissions to create poll, disable
  participant video, disable participant audio, modify text color, configure
  plugins, and so on. Dyte also includes the following four prebuilt presets.
  These presets are pre-defined permissions and UI configurations for the
  participants.
  - webinar_viewer
  - webinar_presenter
  - group_call_host
  - group_call_participant

You can choose to use the default prebuild presets if you don't wish to create
one.

### Recording

You can record the `meeting`, and get a video / audio file.

### Livestreaming

You can livestream the `meeting` to other streaming platforms that support RTMP,
like YouTube, Twitch, etc.

### Analytics

Get analytics data around your `meetings`, like number of minutes, number of
recorded minutes, number of participants, etc.
