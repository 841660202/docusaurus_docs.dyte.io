This topic covers essential concepts related to Dyte Live Video applications.

## Organization

In Dyte, the organization serves as the top-level entity where all participants of your group are added.

- Meetings are created within the organization.
- The API keys are generated for your organization. These API Keys are unique to your organization and are required to use Dyte REST APIs such as when instantiating a meeting.
- Additionally, Dyte considers the organization as a billing unit.

## Meeting

A communication channel created on Dyte is termed as a `meeting`. Dyte offers flexibility in creating meetings based on your requirements:

- You can create a meeting easily with our [UI Kit](/react-ui-kit), leveraging its prebuilt design library of UI components. For further customization to align with your branding, utilize design tokens within the UI kit. This allows adjustments to logos, colors, fonts, borders, spacing, and more.
- For fully customized video calls in your applications, leverage [Core SDKs](/web-core/Introduction).
- Choose your preferred region while creating a meeting by specifying the desired region in the [Create a meeting API](/api#/operations/create_meeting).
- Optionally, you can indicate whether the meeting should be recorded and live streamed upon starting. Use the parameter `record_on_start` and `live_stream_on_start` with a value of true in the [Create a meeting API](/api#/operations/create_meeting).

## Session

In Dyte, a meeting is a communication channel, and each instance of that channel is called a session. A session represents an ongoing meeting within that communication channel.

## Preset

A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that are applied to participants for different meeting types such as Group Call, Webinar, and Livestream. The presets define how a meeting will appear visually and functional aspects of the meeting. They allow customization options like setting maximum number of participants on-screen, permissions to share screen, enabling poll creation, disabling video and audio, adjusting text color, configuring plugins, etc.

For more information, see [Add Presets](/guides/presets/add-presets).

## Participants

Anyone who joins the `meeting`, including actual users and machine users. You can add participants using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant). Participants will have permissions for the meeting depending on the selected preset. The `presetName` must be passed in the body of the Add Participant API request.

## Recording

Dyte records the audio and video of multiple users in a meeting, as well as interactions with Dyte plugins, in a single file using composite recording mode. Dyte recordings are powered by anonymous virtual bot users who join your meeting, record it, and then upload it to Dyte's AWS S3 bucket. For video files,
we currently support the
[H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding) and
[VP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8) codecs. When the recording is finished, recording is stored in Dyte's AWS S3 bucket.

For more information, see [Recording](/guides/recording).

## Live stream

You can livestream the `meeting` to other streaming platforms that support RTMP,
like YouTube, Twitch, etc. Dyte's interactive live streaming (ILS) is an engaging online broadcasting method where host and viewers can actively participate by interacting through comments, chat, polls, and other interactive features.

For more information, see [Start livestreaming with Dyte](/guides/livestream).

## Analytics

Dyte offers comprehensive meeting analytics, including metrics such as meeting duration, number of sessions, recorded minutes, participant count, total bill, and more. You can access this information via the Dashboard in the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/dashboard).

## Meeting ID

The meeting ID is a unique identifier assigned to your meeting, obtained through the [Create a Meeting](/api#/operations/create_meeting) API. This ID is used for various actions, including adding or deleting participants, initiating or stopping meeting recording, starting or ending live streaming, and more.

## Session ID

Session ID is a unique identifier assigned to your meeting, obtained through the [Fetch all sessions of an organization](/api#/operations/GetSessions). This API returns the the session ID along with the associated meeting ID.
