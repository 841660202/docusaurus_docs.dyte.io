Webhook IDs are used to uniquely identify a specific webhook endpoint or events. When a webhook is created in a system, the system assigns it a unique ID that can be used to manage and track the webhook's activity. This ID is usually a string of characters or a number that is specific to the webhook and cannot be duplicated.

Webhook IDs are commonly utilized for the following purposes:

- **Manage the events**: When a webhook is subscribed to a specific event or resource, the webhook ID is used to manage the subscription.

- **Enhanced security**: Typically a signature is added to the request header of the webhook. To further add a security check, Dyte adds a webhook ID to the header. As mentioned earlier, this ID is unique to each webhook subscription and can be used to verify that the request corresponds to the correct subscription.

- **Error handling**: If there is an issue with a webhook request, such as a failed delivery or invalid payload, the webhook ID can be used to identify which specific webhook endpoint caused the error. This can be useful for troubleshooting and resolving issues with webhook integrations.
