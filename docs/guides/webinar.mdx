# Dyte Webinars (Beta)

Dyte now also supports hosting webinars, with much greater access control as compared with meetings. Other than regular meeting features, in webinar hosts can decide and grant permissions for presentation, participants need to raise a request before asking a question on video or before joining the stream to share their videos or screens, option to activate a waiting room for participants before entry into the webinar, and much more. Check screenshots below!

  Host can disable the participant's video, stop their presentation or kick them

  Note that while asking question, participant does not get an option to share

## Create a webinar in 3 simple steps

Here are a few simple steps you need to perform in order to start a webinar of your own using Dyte.

1. Call the "create meeting" endpoint, with the meeting title and other optional configurations. - Returns `meetingId` and `roomName`.
2. Call the "add participant" endpoint with user details and one of the presets, either `default_webinar_host_preset` or `default_webinar_participant_preset`. - Returns `authToken` for the user.
3. Initialize the meeting on frontend using `orgId`, `roomName`, and `authToken`.

:::caution Minimum SDK versions

Make sure your Dyte web client is updated to version `0.6.0` or higher. Edit your `package.json` by finding the line that contains `dyte-client` as a dependency and update that to `"dyte-client": "^0.6.0",`.

Similarly for mobile, make sure your client is updated to version `0.1.27` for Android, `1.9` for iOS, `0.0.9-a` for React Native and `0.1.0` for Flutter.

:::

### Create a meeting

Call the [create meeting](/api/#/operations/create_meeting) endpoint from your server. This API does not have any mandatory parameters.

Your request body will look like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Webinar"
}
```

You will receive a response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "",
  "data": {
    "meeting": {
      "id": "cddfd4a8-d6fb-4d15-be6b-269c6dedfa70",
      "title": "Webinar",
      "roomName": "hexagonal-trip",
      "status": "LIVE",
      "createdAt": "2020-12-21T17:30:00.000Z",
      "participants": []
    }
  }
}
```

Save `data.meeting.id` and `data.meeting.roomName` for later use.

### Add a participant

Call the ["add particpant"](/api/#/operations/add_participant) endpoint from your server. This API needs meeting ID from the previous response, as well as needs a `clientSpecificId` in the body to use as a unique identifier for the participant. You also need to define the values of `preset` parameter as either `default_webinar_host_preset` or `default_webinar_participant_preset` depending on whether you want to assing the host role or the participant role for this particular user.

Your request body will look like this:

````json
{
    "clientSpecificId": "your-unique-user-id",
    "userDetails": {
        "name": "Webinar Host"
    },
    "presetName": "default_webinar_host_preset"
}```

You will receive a response that looks like this:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "",
    "data": {
        "authResponse": {
            "userAdded": true,
            "authToken": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJp..."
        }
    }
}
````

Save `data.authResponse.authToken` for later use.

### Initialize the meeting on frontend

Get the `roomName` from the "create meeting" API call and participant `authToken` from the "add participant" API call from your backend, and initialize the meeting on frontend.

#### Example - Initializing client in React

```jsx
import { DyteMeeting } from 'dyte-client';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <DyteMeeting
        onInit={(meeting) => {}}
        clientId={`orgId || clientId`}
        meetingConfig={{
          roomName: `roomName`,
          authToken: `authToken`,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
