The OpenTok [Shim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)>) by Dyte is a package that allows you to migrate your video calling applications from [OpenTok](https://tokbox.com/developer/) to Dyte infrastructure.

Dyte provides a set of shim libraries that serve as seamless replacements for the Vonage video APIs (previously known as Tokbox OpenTok). These shims serve as a fundamental building block for migrating your application from OpenTok to Dyte infrastructure.

For more information on how to migrate, see [Migrate from OpenTok to Dyte with Shim](/guides/migration/opentok/opentok-shim-by-dyte).
