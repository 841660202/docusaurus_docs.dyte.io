The Twilio [Shim](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)>) by Dyte is a package that allows you to migrate your video calling applications from [Twilio](https://sdk.twilio.com/js/video/releases/2.27.0/docs/index.html) to Dyte infrastructure.

Dyte provides a set of shim libraries that serve as seamless replacements for the Twilio video APIs. These shims serve as a fundamental building block for migrating your real-time voice and video applications from Twilio to Dyte infrastructure.

For more information on how to migrate, see [Migrate from Twilio to Dyte with Shim](/guides/migration/twilio/twilio-shim-by-dyte).
