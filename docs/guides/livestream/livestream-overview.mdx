# Introduction to Dyte's Interactive Livestreaming

Livestreaming is the live broadcasting and transmission of video or audio content over the internet. It enables the real-time capture and streaming of events, activities, or performances, allowing viewers to watch and interact with the content as it happens.

Livestreaming is commonly used for one-to-many communication, where a single source streams the content to multiple viewers or participants. This capability makes it possible to broadcast various events such as webinars, hackathons, conferences, online classes, concerts, all-hands meetings, and even personal metaverse parties.

Interactive live streaming (ILS) is an engaging online broadcasting method that delivers video and audio content over the internet, typically through a web viewer or application. With ILS, viewers actively participate by interacting in real time through comments, chat, polls, and other interactive features.

## Key Features of Dyte's ILS Platform

Dyte's Interactive Live Streaming (ILS) feature is designed around the concept of a **stage** that is accessible to both hosts and viewers. Hosts have direct access to the stage, while viewers can request to join it. The stage is broadcasted live to all viewers.

With Dyte's ILS, you can:

- **Reach a large audience**: Broadcast your meeting to up to 100,000 viewers with just 3 to 6 seconds of delay.
- **Engage with participants**: Chat with your audience during the live stream, fostering real-time interaction.
- **Create interactive polls**: Share polls with participants, allowing them to actively contribute and provide feedback.
- **Invite viewers to join the stage**: Viewers can raise their hand, and host can invite them to the stage to participate directly.
- **Multi-participant video calls**: Conduct real-time video calls with multiple participants and stream them to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, or LinkedIn.
- **Seamless integration**: Easily integrate with your existing video workflow by incorporating HLS without additional servers or infrastructure.
- **Restream to multiple platforms**: Forward your livestream to any platform that supports RTMP, such as YouTube, Twitch, LinkedIn, and more.
- **Livestream any custom video input**: Go live from applications like [OBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio), [ffmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg), and others, allowing you to stream any RTMP input from any source.
- **Customize your streaming experience**: Have complete control over your streaming, from a simple one-to-many stream to a highly interactive live event.

### Livestream a Dyte meeting

You can livestream any meeting that you created using the [create a meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting) API.

- To begin live streaming the meeting as soon as it starts, specify the
  `live_stream_on_start` parameter in the
  [Create a meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting) API.
- Otherwise, use the
  [Start livestreaming a meeting](/api/?v=v2#/paths/meetings-meeting_id--livestreams/post)
  API to start live streaming the meeting as needed.
