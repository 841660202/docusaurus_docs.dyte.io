# Introduction to Dyte's Interactive Livestreaming

Interactive live streaming (ILS) is an engaging online broadcasting method that delivers video and audio content over the internet, typically through a web viewer or application. With ILS, viewers actively participate by interacting in real time through comments, chat, polls, and other interactive features.

During live streaming, RTMP streams transport real-time data, including video and audio to viewers over the internet. This capability facilitates the broadcasting of diverse events like webinars, hackathons, conferences, online classes, concerts, all-hands meetings, and even your own metaverse party.

- Broadcast a multi-participant video call in real time that
  supports RTMP to your preferred streaming platform, such as YouTube, Twitch,
  or LinkedIn.

- Broadcast a meeting to up to 100,000 viewers with low latency of just 3 to 6 seconds.
- Chat with participants during the live stream.
- Create and share polls with participants.
- Allow viewers to raise their hand, and the host can invite them to join the stage.
- Host can directly invite viewers to join the stage.
