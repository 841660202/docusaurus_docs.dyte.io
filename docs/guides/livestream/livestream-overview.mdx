# Livestreaming Overview

Livestreaming is the broadcast of video and audio content over the internet,
usually through a web viewer or an application. Live streaming sends RTMP
streams, or real-time data such as video and audio from call participants, over
the internet to viewers. This can be used to broadcast events such as webinars,
hackathons, conferences, online classes, concerts, all-hands meetings, and even
your own metaverse party.

Dyte supports the following:

- Livestreaming from applications like
  [OBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio),
  [ffmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg), and others. To put it simply,
  you can livestream any RTMP input from any source using Dyte.
- Allows you to broadcast a multi-participant video call in real time that
  supports RTMP to your preferred streaming platform, such as YouTube, Twitch,
  or LinkedIn.
- Provides complete control over the streaming experience, from a simple
  one-to-many stream to a highly interactive live event.
- Allows you to integrate [HLS](https://dyte.io/blog/hls/) into your existing
  video workflow without any additional servers or infrastructure. Youâ€™ll have
  access to better quality streams with low latency and wide device support.
- Forward livestreams of your meeting to any platform that supports RTMP, such
  as YouTube, Twitch, LinkedIn, and more.
