# Overview

Livestreaming is the live broadcasting and transmission of video or audio content over the internet. It enables the real-time capture and streaming of events, activities, or performances, allowing viewers to watch and interact with the content as it happens. It is commonly used for one-to-many communication, where a single source streams the content to multiple viewers or participants.

Interactive live streaming (ILS) is an engaging online broadcasting method where host and viewers can actively participate by interacting through comments, chat, polls, and other interactive features.

Dyte's Interactive Live Streaming (ILS) feature revolves around a virtual **stage** where hosts have direct access and viewers can request to join.

- Hosts: They have full control of the stage and can actively participate, share video and audio, conduct presentations, and more.
- Viewers: They can request to join the stage using interactive features like chat or raised hand. Once approved by the host, viewers can contribute by sharing their video and audio or participating in discussions.
- The stage is where all the action happens. It's broadcasted live to all viewers, creating a real-time and engaging experience for everyone.

  [Start livestreaming a meeting](/api/?v=v2#/paths/meetings-meeting_id--livestreams/post)
