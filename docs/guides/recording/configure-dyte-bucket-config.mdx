title: Configure Uploads to Dyte's Bucket
sidebar_position: 8

By default, dyte will upload all recordings to dyte's own S3 bucket located in the
`ap-south-1` AWS region, and also generate a presigned URL with an expiry of 7 days.
This URL is available in the `downloadUrl` field linked to each recording.

If you wish to disable uploads to dyte's bucket, you can pass the `dyte_bucket_config`
parameter in the [Start Recording endpoint](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording), for
example:
```json
{
  "dyte_bucket_config": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

:::info note

Recordings which don't have an external storage config, and also disable
uploads to dyte's bucket, will not be uploaded to any location, and will be treated as 
invalid!
