You can modify the codec which is used for recording the videos. We currently
support the following codecs:

- **H264 (default)**: Records video using the H.264 codec with 1280px \* 720px
  resolution, and 384 kbps AAC audio in MP4 container.
- **VP8**: Records video using the the VP8 codec with 1280px \* 720px
  resolution, and Vorbis codec audio in WebM container.

You can change the codec by specifying the codec in the `video_config` field in
the [Start Recording endpoint](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording), for
example:

```json
{
  "video_config": {
    "codec": "H264"
  }
}
```

:::info note

Meetings recorded using the `record_on_start` parameter currently donâ€™t support
configuring video codecs, and will use the `H264` codec by default.
