## Introduction 

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Interconnect refers to the setup where two or more different SIP-based networks or systems are connected to enable the flow of voice traffic between them.

Dyteâ€™s SIP Interconnect allows you to bridge VOIP calls from an external third party service to Dyteâ€™s WebRTC meetings. That means you can use SIP methodologies to connect with our SIP Servers and have it bridged to participants who might be connected through Dyte Client SDKs (WebRTC)

## Usage

The simplest way to call a SIP Endpoint is using a SIP Client, you can use clients like Zoiper, Telephone(Mac only), etc. 

You will be provided with -

1. A Username and password combinationa
2. A SIP Server Endpoint. The default port is 5060.

:::note
This feature is in beta. Contact us to get Username, Password and SIP Server Endpoint

:::

Now to connect to a specific Dyte `meetingId`. You can dial in using SIP with the given username and password and an URI in the format `sip:<meetingId>@<DyteSIPEndpoint>`

ðŸŽ‰ That is it, your SIP call should now be bridged with Dyte's WebRTC meeting

## Example

### Integration with Twilio Voice

To connect with Dyte we are going to use TwiML service to perform the SIP dialin.

#### Guide

Steps to follow
1. Get a Twilio account. You can go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio and create an account
2. Buy a VOIP number
3. Configure the VOIP number to [use webhook to handle any incoming calls](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/webhooks/voice-webhooks#incoming-voice-call)

4. Now when you get a webhook, you can respond with a [TwiML SIP Dial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/twiml/sip) verb with Dyte's SIP configuration

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
<Dial>
    <Sip username="<DyteSIPUsername>" password="<DyteSIPPassword>>">sip:meetingId@DyteSIPEndpoint</Sip>
</Dial>
</Response>
```

#### Express Example

```js
const express = require('express');
const VoiceResponse = require('twilio').twiml.VoiceResponse;
const urlencoded = require('body-parser').urlencoded;

const app = express();

// Parse incoming POST params with Express middleware
app.use(urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// Create a route that will handle Twilio webhook requests, sent as an
// HTTP POST to /voice in our application
app.post('/voice', (request, response) => {
    console.log({ request });
    // Use the Twilio Node.js SDK to build an XML response
    const twiml = new VoiceResponse();

    const dial = twiml.dial();
    dial.sip({
        username: "<DyteSIPUsername>",
        password: "<DyteSIPPassword>",
    }, 'sip:<meetingId>@<DyteSIPEndpoint>');

    // Render the response as XML in reply to the webhook request
    response.type('text/xml');
    console.log({ twiml: twiml.toString() })
    response.send(twiml.toString());
});
```

Hurray ðŸŽ‰, You have completed the Twilio Voice setup guide.
