# Livestreaming Dyte Meeting to HLS

Dyte allows livestreaming, via RTMP as well as HLS, for all Dyte meetings. If you want us to manage the output to RTMP instead, check [this doc instead](./livestreaming-other-platforms).

To stream a meeting, use the API in the following order:

1. Start a livestream by using the `POST` endpoint.
2. Use the `PUT` endpoint to stop the stream.

## Considerations

1. Livestream will stop if there is no participant in the meeting for 120 seconds (2 minutes).
2. There can only be one active stream of a meeting.
3. Currently, there is a lag of a maximum of 30 seconds between calling the API and the actual start of stream. We are working on reducing this lag.
4. Maximum streaming time is 24 hours. Stream will automatically stop after the expiry of that period from the time of stream start.

## Start a livestream

Request:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/:orgid/meetings/:meetingid/livestreaming \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY your-api-key'
```

Response:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "liveStreaming": {
            "streamID": "STREAMID",
            "streamURL": "rtmp://URL/LiveApp/STREAMID",
            "playerURL": "https://URL/LiveApp/play.html?name=STREAMID",
            "hlsPlaylist": "https://URL/LiveApp/streams/STREAMID.m3u8"
        },
    "message": "LiveStreaming started",
    "success": true
}
```

From the response

1. `data.liveStreaming.streamURL` can be used as an input to any other RTMP compatible app or API (such as Twitch, YouTube, etc)
2. `data.liveStreaming.playerURL` can be used as an embedded HTML video player
3. `data.liveStreaming.hlsPlaylist` can be used with any HLS compatible app or player (such as VLC media player, native HTML5 video tag, etc)

## Stop a livestream

Request:

```shell
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/:orgid/meetings/:meetingid/livestreaming \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY your-api-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"action": "stop"
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "message": "LiveStreaming stopped",
  "success": true
}
```
