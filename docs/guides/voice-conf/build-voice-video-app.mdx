This topic gives a quick walkthrough of the steps involved in integrating high-quality real-time
communication features into your app using Dyte's Live Video.

## Integrate Dyte

1. To get started with Dyte, you must first register in the
   [Developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io).

2. Copy the [API Keys](https://dev.dyte.io/apikeys) for your organization from
   the Developer portal. These API Keys are unique to your organization and are
   required to use Dyte REST APIs such as when instantiating a meeting.

3. [Create presets](https://dev.dyte.io/roles-presets) using the Developer
   portal. A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that would be
   applied to a participant. For more information, see [Add Presets](/guides/presets/add-presets).

4. Create a Dyte meeting using the
   [Create Meeting API](/api#/operations/create_meeting). This API returns a
   unique identifier for your meeting. <br/>

You may want to persist the meeting ID in your database.

5. After you've created the meeting, add each participant to the meeting using
   the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant). The `presetName`
   created earlier must be passed in the body of the Add Participant API
   request.

   The API response contains the user authentication token `authToken`.

6. Use the `authToken` to initialize any of the frontend SDKs.

   Each SDKâ€™s Quickstart Guide has code samples for how to perform the following steps for that specific SDK.

Dyte meetings do not have a date or time associated with them, so you can create
them in advance or just when users need to join the meeting. The idea is that
your backend controls when to distribute `authToken` and thus you can share the
tokens with the users at the scheduled time.
