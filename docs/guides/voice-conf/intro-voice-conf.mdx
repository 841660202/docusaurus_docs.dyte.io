- **Chat**: Allows participants to chat with each in real-time.
- **Poll**: You can create polls.
- **Breakout rooms**: Breakout rooms allow participants of a meeting to split into smaller groups for targeted discussions and collaboration. For more information, see [Create a Breakout Room](/guides/integrate-core-features/breakoutroom/create-breakout-rooms).
- **Virtual background**: You can add custom virtual background to Dyte video calls. You can add background to any of our supported web applications, React, Angular, JavaScript, and so on including UI Kit and core SDKs. For more information, see [Add Custom Virtual Background to Dyte meetings](/guides/advanced-features/add-virtual-background).
- ** Multi screenshare**: Allow participants in the call to share screen with others in real-time.
- **Transcription**: You can integrate Google Speech-to-Text (STT) into Dyte meetings to add audio transcriptions. This third-party service accurately transcribes participants' spoken audio in real-time. By leveraging Google Translate, the transcriptions can be easily translated into individual participants' desired languages. For more information, see [Add Audio Transcriptions to Video Meetings](https://dyte.io/blog/audio-transcriptions-video-meeting/).
- **Custom filters**: Dyte SDKs provide flexibility not just in terms of the UI but in terms of media as well.

- ** Noise cancellation**: Dyte offers AI-powered noise and echo cancellation (powered by Krisp).

## Components of a Dyte voice application

To integrate Dyte, you need both frontend and backend components:

### Backend HTTP REST APIs

Your backend utilizes Dyte REST APIs to perform actions such as:

- [Create meetings](/api#/operations/create_meeting)
- [Add participants to a meeting](/api#/operations/add_participant)
- [Start recording a meeting](/api#/operations/start_recording) and so on

### Frontend SDKs

Your applications bundle Dyte Core SDKs (and UI Kits) to acquire, transmit and play media, and manage network connections.

- **Core SDK**: The Dyte Core SDK is designed to provide developers with an easy way to incorporate real-time communication (RTC) solutions into their apps and websites. With full customization and branding options, you can build your own user interface from the ground up without dealing with complicated media layers. For more information, see [Introduction to Core SDK](/web-core/Introduction).

- **UI Kit**: Dyte's UI Kit is a prebuilt design library of UI components designed to simplify the integration of video and voice calls into your app or website. It is build on top of the core SDKs, which handle all the low-level media and network handling parts of a meeting and exposes simpler APIs to use. For more information, see [UI Kit](/react-ui-kit).

## Supported Platforms

Dyte currently supports the following platforms:

- **Mobile**: Flutter, Android (Java/Kotlin), iOS (Objective-C/Swift), React Native
- **Web**: Javascript Core SDK + UI Kit for React JS, Angular, and Web Components for other frameworks.
