This topic provides a simple guide to integrate Dyte's voice conferencing solution into your app.

The following diagram illustrates the steps involved and demonstrates the interaction between Dyte's backend and frontend during the integration process.

## Step 1: Register in the Developer Portal

To get started with Dyte, you must first register in the [Developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io).

## Step 2: Get your API Keys

Copy the [API Keys](https://dev.dyte.io/apikeys) for your organization from
the Developer portal. These API Keys are unique to your organization and are
required to use Dyte REST APIs such as when instantiating a meeting.

## Step 3: Create Presets

A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that would be
applied to a participant. For more information, see [Add
Presets](/guides/integrate-core-features/add-presets).

1. In the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/), click **Presets**, and click **Create New**.

     alt="livestream-create-preset"
     className="livestrem-create-preset"
   />
2. In the **Select Meeting Type**, select **Group Call**.

     width="600"
     height="300"
     alt="chat-sdk"
     className="add-preset-live-video"
   />

3. Set permissions and UI configurations.

4. Once youâ€™ve made all the changes that you need to add to your preset, click **Save** at the right-corner.
   <img
     src="/static/livestreaming/savepreset.png"
     width="600"
     height="300"
     alt="livestream-save"
     className="livestream-save-preset"
   />
5. Enter the name for your preset and click **Save**.

## Step 4: Create a Meeting

Create a Dyte meeting using the
[Create Meeting API](/api#/operations/create_meeting). This API returns a
unique identifier for your meeting. <br/>

You may want to persist the meeting ID in your database.

## Step 5: Add Participants

After you've created the meeting, add participants to the meeting using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant).

The preset created in the previous step must be passed in the body of the Add Participant API request. Specify the name of the preset in the `preset_name` parameter.

This API returns the authentication `token` that is required to initialize your frontend SDKs.

Dyte meetings do not have a date or time associated with them, so you can create
them in advance or just when users need to join the meeting. The idea is that
your backend controls when to distribute authentication `token` and thus you can share the
tokens with the users at the scheduled time.
