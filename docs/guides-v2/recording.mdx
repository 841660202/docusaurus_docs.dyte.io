Dyte allows you to record your meetings. Note that this feature will only record
the Grid part of the meeting. Typically, the result of such a recording is a
MPEG-4 (.mp4) file, encoded using the H.264 codec; however, you can change this
if you wish.

## Workflow

A typical workflow for recording a meeting involves the following steps:

1. Start a recording by using the
   [`POST` endpoint](http://docs.dyte.io/api/?v=v1#/operations/start_recording).
2. Stop the recording by using the
   [`PUT` endpoint](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/stop_recording).
3. Use the
   [`GET` endpoint](http://docs.dyte.io/api/?v=v1#/operations/get_recording) to
   fetch a pre-signed URL for downloading the recording.

## Recording states

Recording can have one of these states, which are also notified through
[webhooks](./integrating-with-webhooks#recordingstatusupdate):

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| INVOKED   | The recording function has been invoked and will start recording the meeting very shortly.                                                                                 |
| RECORDING | The meeting is currently being recorded.                                                                                                                                   |
| UPLOADING | The recording has been stopped and the file is being uploaded to cloud storage. The storage would be Dyte's if no storage parameters are passed in the recording API call. |
| UPLOADED  | The recording file upload is complete.                                                                                                                                     |
| ERRORED   | There was an error while recording the meeting and the file wouldn't be available.                                                                                         |

:::info Considerations

1. Recording will stop if there are no participants in a meeting for 60 seconds
   (1 minute).
2. There can only be one active recording of a meeting at any given time.
3. The average file size for one hour of recording is approximately `300MB`.
4. Maximum recording time is 24 hours. Recording will automatically stop after
   24 hours have elapsed since the recording's start time. This option can be
   configured to any value up to 24 hours by passing the `maxSeconds` parameter
   in the start recording API request.

## Recording settings

It is possible to modify the codec which is used for recording the videos. We
currently support three codecs:

1. H264 (default):
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/h264_sample.webm)
2. VP8:
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/vp8_sample.webm)
3. VP9:
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/vp9_sample.webm)

You can change the codec by specifying the codec in the `videoConfig` field when
you are creating a recording. eg:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cluster.dyte.in/v2/recordings \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic NzBjNWy00Y2YzLTk5MDctYmVGNiNGUzZWY1MGI1' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "meeting_id": "97440c6a-140b-40a9-9499-b23fd7a3868a",
  "storage_config": {
    "type": "aws",
    "access_key": "string",
    "secret_key": "string",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "bucket": "string",
    "path": "string"
  }
}'
```

:::caution Resolution

By default, Dyte uses a resolution of **1280 x 720** (720p) for all recordings.
If you require a higher resolution, please contact us directly to enable
recordings in **1920 x 1080** (1080p) for your organization.
