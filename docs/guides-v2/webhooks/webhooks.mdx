title: 'Use webhooks to receive real-time updates'
---

Dyte uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens. Webhooks
are particularly useful for asynchronous events, such as when a recording is
uploaded or when a participant joins your meeting.

# How Dyte uses webhooks

A webhook enables Dyte to push real-time updates to your application. Stripe
uses HTTPS to send events to your webhook endpoint as a JSON payload. You can
then use these events to perform actions in your backend systems. To learn more,
see Dyte webhook events overview.

# Steps to receive webhooks

You can start receiving webhook events in your application by following the
steps in this section:

1. Identify the events you want to monitor and the event payloads you want to
   parse.
2. Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your backend
   application.
3. Handle requests from Dyte by parsing each event object and
   returning **`2xx`** response status codes.
4. Deploy your webhook endpoint so it’s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
5. Register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL using the
   [Dyte developer portal](http://dev.dyte.io) or Webhook APIs.

# Creating webhook endpoints

Creating a webhook endpoint is no different from creating any other API route on
your backend. It's an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint on your server with a URL. You can
use one endpoint to handle several different event types at once or set up
individual endpoints for specific events.

## Step 1: Identify the events to monitor

Use the [events overview guide](/guides/v2/webhooks/webhook-events) to identify
the events your webhook endpoint needs to parse.
