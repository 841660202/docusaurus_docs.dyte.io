title: 'Verify signatures'

Dyte signs the webhook events it sends to your endpoints by including a
signature in each event's `dyte-signature` header

This allows you to verify that the event came from Dyte itself and not a
malicious server pretending to be Dyte. You can verify signatures by performing
the following steps.
