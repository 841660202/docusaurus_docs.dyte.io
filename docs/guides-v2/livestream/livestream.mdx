# Livestreaming API Integration Guide

#

Dyte Livestreaming adds live video and voice interactive streaming to any online
experience. It provides complete control over the streaming experience, from a
simple one-to-many stream to a highly interactive live event.

Dyte allows livestreaming, via RTMP as well as HLS, for all Dyte meetings. If
you want us to manage the output to RTMP instead, check
[this doc instead](./livestreaming-other-platforms).

Dyte Livestreaming provides two modes of operations:

1. Livestreaming Independently
2. Livestreaming a Meeting

These modes help you manage various livestream usecases. Letâ€™s understand what
both of these mean:

- **Livestreaming Independently**: If you want to control what you stream and
  how it is distributed, this is the way to go. Individual ingest URLs can be
  created for ingesting a livestream from apps like OBS, ffmpeg, and others, as
  well as playback URLs to play it in your preferred player. For more
  information, follow the guide [here](/guides-v2/livestream-any-rtmp).

- **Livestreaming a Meeting**: If you want to stream a meeting to a large number
  of people, this is an excellent option. Dyte provides APIs to automatically
  start livestreaming a meeting, as well as an SDK player that allows users to
  watch the livestream in high quality. For example, livestream a meeting for an
  events platform, a virtual workspace to host large events such as hackathons,
  conferences, or even your own metaverse party.

## Livestreaming a meeting

Starting a meeting livestream is as simple as making the following request:

```bash title="Starting a livestream"
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cluster.dyte.in/v2/meetings/{meetingId}/livestreams \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

```json title="Livestream started response"
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "OFFLINE",
    "name": null,
    "meeting_id": "188566bc-8770-4ca0-9eb3-24b594ecaf7e",
    "ingest_server": "rtmps://2ec802dd47b0.global-contribute.live-video.net:443/app/",
    "id": "7088bba8-f522-49a8-b59b-3cd0e946bbb0",
    "stream_key": "sk_ap-south-1_AfnVpeYZjidO_fBpWKody7sDUOEfy9Zc6XAZegkR0Va",
    "playback_url": "https://2ec802dd47b0.ap-south-1.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/ap-south-1.944908621410.channel.rVKA2KM5Lunt.m3u8"
  }
}
```

### Fetching active livestreams

Fetching details about an active livestreaming is also an HTTP request away.

```bash title="Fetching details about an active livestream"
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.cluster.dyte.in/v2/meetings/{meetingId}/active-livestream \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

```json title="Active livestream response"
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "LIVE",
    "name": null,
    "meeting_id": "188566bc-8770-4ca0-9eb3-24b594ecaf7e",
    "ingest_seconds": 0,
    "viewer_seconds": 0,
    "ingest_server": "rtmps://2ec802dd47b0.global-contribute.live-video.net:443/app/",
    "id": "7088bba8-f522-49a8-b59b-3cd0e946bbb0",
    "stream_key": "sk_ap-south-1_AfnVpeYZjidO_fBpWKody7sDUOEfy9Zc6XAZegkR0Va",
    "playback_url": "https://2ec802dd47b0.ap-south-1.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/ap-south-1.944908621410.channel.rVKA2KM5Lunt.m3u8"
  }
}
```

### Stopping a livestream

You guessed it, it's also an HTTP request away.

```bash title="Stop livestream request"
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cluster.dyte.in/v2/meetings/meetingId/active-livestream/stop \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

```json title="Stop livestream response"
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "livestream stopped"
  }
}
```
