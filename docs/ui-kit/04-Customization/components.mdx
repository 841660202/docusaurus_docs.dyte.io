## Action Buttons

These are the buttons which are used to perform a specific task such as toggling microphone, camera, screenshare or leaving a meeting.

- dyte-mic-toggle

## Components - Self

### Preview in Settings

You can see previews of your camera and check microphone in the `dyte-settings` component.

### Self Control Buttons

These are buttons which run an action on `self`.

These are the various toggle buttons mentioned in [Action Buttons](#action-buttons) section above.

## Audio Handling

`<dyte-peers-audio />` component is provided in the UI Kit which handles audio for all peers in a single component.

You will need to use this component along with `<dyte-peer-view />` so as to hear the participants.

## Participant Components

These are components which accept a participant object and renders their state.

A `<dyte-peer-view />` component is used to render the video of the participant, along with their audio visualizers and name tags.

You can use `<dyte-name-tag />`, `<dyte-avatar />` and `<dyte-audio-visualizer />` inside a peer-view component so they are placed appropriately and you can customize their UI and position by passing in props.

Example usage:

To render the peer-view with `gradient` variant:

```html
<dyte-peer-view variant="gradient" name-tag-position="bottom-center">
  <dyte-name-tag></dyte-name-tag>
  <dyte-avatar />
  <dyte-audio-visualzier></dyte-audio-visualizer>
</dyte-peer-view>
```

To render audio-visualizer with name-tag at the start:

```html
<dyte-peer-view variant="solid" name-tag-position="bottom-center">
  <dyte-name-tag>
    <dyte-audio-visualzier slot="start"></dyte-audio-visualizer>
  </dyte-name-tag>
  <dyte-avatar></dyte-avatar>
</dyte-peer-view>
```
