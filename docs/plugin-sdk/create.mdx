### Steps to create a Plugin

1. Run the following command to create a Plugin. Once your plugin is created you should see a config file called `dyte-config.json`. You can use this to [configure your plugin properties](https://docs.dyte.io/plugin-sdk/setup/customize).
```shell
cd <your-project-directory> && dyte plugins create
```

2. Once your plugin has been created, verify whether it appears in the list of plugins for your organization. 
```shell
dyte plugins ls
```

### Next Step

There are several settings that can be configured for your plugin. Read: [Manage your plugin](https://docs.dyte.io/plugin-sdk/setup/manage).

Once your plugin is created, you can alter how different users will interact with it via the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io). You can also [modify details](https://docs.dyte.io/plugin-sdk/config/configuration) of your plugin like it's name, icon, description and much more.
