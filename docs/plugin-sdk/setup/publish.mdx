Dyte also allows you to publish multiple versions of your Plugin SDK. The Dyte CLI can be used to update the versions. Once you've published a plugin, it's ready to use.

Perform the following steps to publish the Plugins.

1. If you're using a JavaScript library or framework, you'll need to create a build first. If not you can skip this step.
```
npm run build
```

2. If you want to publish a new version, update the version in `dyte-config.json`. We recommend using semantic versioning.

3. Copy `dyte-config.json` into your build folder.

4. Navigate to the build folder and run the publish command. 
```shell
cd build
dyte plugins publish -l
```

:::note
The `-l` or `--latest` option is required if you want your plugin's new version to be deployed. If the `-l` option is absent, the new version of the plugin will be saved in our storage bucket, but it will not be served.
:::


The plugin will be published under the organization used to authorize Dyte CLI. 

You can now manage ACL settings for the plugin from the [Dyte Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io).
