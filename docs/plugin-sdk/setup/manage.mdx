### Version specific deployments

Dyte lets you publish multiple versions of your plugins. You can choose to
deploy a specific version.

List all available versions of your plugin

```shell
dyte plugins version list
```

You can now select the version you wish to deploy.

If you do not add the `--v` flag, it re-deploys the latest version.

```shell
dyte plugins deploy --v-1.x.x
```

### Unpublishing

Unpublishing a plugin removes all versions of it from our database and your
meetings.

```shell
dyte plugins unpublish
```

If you wish to delete a specific version of the plugin you can do that with

```shell
dyte plugins version delete -v <version>
```

### Plugin configuration

You can update your `dyte-config` to update properties like name, description,
build path and more. These changes will reflect once you publish or deploy the
plugin.

### Access control and visibility

Each Dyte user is associated to a preset. This preset dictates the meeting
expirence for that user. You can customize how this preset can interact with a
plugin using [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io) presets.

Customize who can view, launch & control a plugin using the
[Preset Editor](https://dev.dyte.io/roles-presets).

### Next Step

Understand how you can use the modules and offerings provided by the Plugin SDK
to build your plugin.
