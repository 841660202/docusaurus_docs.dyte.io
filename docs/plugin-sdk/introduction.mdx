# Introduction to Dyte Plugin SDK

The modern world revolves around real-time collaboration. It's how the world
communicates in order to engage and perform various tasks. The rise of this
approach, however, demands a seamless experience within a meeting application
for staying in touch, sharing files, visualizing data, playing games, and so on.

Dyte Plugins allow you to collaborate and interact in real time within your Dyte
meetings without having to leave the meeting room.

## What are Dyte Plugins?

Dyte meetings are more than just a video and voice conferencing tool — it’s a
hub for collaboration. Dyte Plugins enable that real-time collaboration and
interaction for all the users within the meeting. Dyte includes out-of-the-box
plugin support for a variety of apps, including YouTube, Remote Browser, Miro,
Chess, and others. Using these Plugins, you can have the most immersive,
collaborative, and human interaction in your video and voice calls without
leaving the meeting. A few examples are listed here:

- YouTube: Play videos locally in Sync for everyone instead of a choppy
  screen-share.
- DocSync: Open PDFs & PPTs that load for everyone and are in sync thus
  achieving crystal clarity.
- Remote Browser: Browse the web together on a server-hosted browser.

If the required plugins are not available, Dyte also allows you to create your
own interactive in-call applications using the Plugin SDK.
