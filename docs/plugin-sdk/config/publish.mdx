You can publish and maintain various versions of your plugin using Dyte CLI. 

1. In case you are using a javascript library like react, you would first need to generate a build.

    ```
    npm run build
    ```
2. Update the version in `dyte-config.json` if you wish to publish a new version.

3. Copy `dyte-config.json` into your build folder. move into the build folder and execute the publish command.
    ```
    cd build
    dyte plugins publish -l
    ```

:::note
The `-l` or `--latest` option is required if you want your plugin's new version to be deployed. If the `-l` option is absent, the new version of the plugin will be saved in our storage bucket, but it will not be served.
:::


The plugin will be published under the organization used to authorize Dyte CLI. 

You can now manage ACL settings for the plugin from the [Dyte Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io). Read more about how you can manage plugins with Dyte CLI [here](https://docs.dyte.io/cli/plugins#publishing-a-plugin).
