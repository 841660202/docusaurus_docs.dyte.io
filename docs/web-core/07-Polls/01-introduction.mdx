# Introduction

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides methods to create, vote, and manage polls.

`meeting.polls.items` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where each element is an object of type  `Poll`.


The type `Poll` is defined in the following manner.
```ts
interface Poll {
    id: string;
    question: string;
    options: PollOption[];
    anonymous: boolean;
    hideVotes: boolean;
    createdBy: string;
    createdByUserId: string;
    voted: string[];
}

interface PollOption {
    text: string;
    votes: { id: string, name: string }[];
    count: number;
}
```

The property `Poll.voted` stores the `id` of participants who have voted on the poll.

The property `PollOptions.votes.id` stores the `id` of participants who have voted for a particular option on the poll.
