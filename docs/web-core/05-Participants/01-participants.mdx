# Participants

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `meeting.participants`. This **does not** include the local user. Use the methods and events to consume the participants data. 
For example, to get all the participants who joined the meeting:

```ts
// get all joined participants
const joinedParticipants = meeting.participants.joined;
```

The `meeting.participants` object has the following properties.

- `joined`: A map that contains all the participants who have joined the meeting.
- `waitlisted`: A map that contains all the participants waiting to join the meeting.
- `active`: A map that contains all the active participants producing media (audio/video/screen).
- `pinned`: A map that contains all the pinned participants of the meeting.
- `count`: The number of participants who are joined in the meeting.
- `pageCount`: Number of pages available in paginated mode. 
- `maxActiveParticipantsCount`: The maximum number of participants that can be present in the active state.

Therefore, if you were to make a grid of participants, you'd use the `active` map, but to display all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined` map.

## Set participant view mode

The view mode indicates whether the participants are populated in `ACTIVE_GRID` mode or `PAGINATED` mode. In `ACTIVE_GRID` mode, the partcipants are automatically replaced in `meeting.participants.active`, based on who's speaking, whose video is on, and such other factors.

In `PAGINATED` mode, the participants in `meeting.participants.active` will be fixed. Only when you call the `meeting.participants.setPage(pageNumber)` method, it will replace the `active` participants with a different set of participants.

You can change the participant view between `ACTIVE_GRID` and `PAGINATED` mode using the following method. This will trigger `viewModeChanged` event as a side affect.

```ts
// set the view mode to paginated
await meeting.participants.setViewMode('PAGINATED');

// set the view mode to active grid
await meeting.participants.setViewMode('ACTIVE_GRID');
```

## Set page number in paginated mode

The `setPage()` method allows you to switch between pages of participants present in the meeting.

```ts
// switch to second page
await meeting.participants.setPage(2);
```
 
## Host control methods

The `meeting.participants` object has host control methods that allow you to disable the audio and video streams of other users in the meeting (given that the user preset has the right permissions).

```ts
// mute all participants
await meeting.participants.disableAllAudio();

// disable video for all participants
await meeting.participants.disableAllVideo();
```

To remove all participants from a meeting, you can call the `kickAll()` method.

```ts
// remove all participants from the meeting
await meeting.participants.kickAll();
```
