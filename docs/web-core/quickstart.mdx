# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.

:::

### Joining a room

The `DyteClient` is the main entry point to the SDK. It is the only class that
you need to instantiate in order to use the SDK.

To instantiate `DyteClient`, you can run the following command:

```js
const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
  authToken,
});
await meeting.joinRoom();
```

You can get the `authToken` using our
[backend APIs](/api#/operations/add_participant) and then pass it to the `init`
method of `DyteClient`.

:::info

Once join room process completes `roomJoined` event is emitted on `meeting.self`
namespace. If you want to take any actions like enabling audio, video or start
and stop recording, they should be performed after the `roomJoined` event is
fired.

For example:

```js
meeting.self.on('roomJoined', () => {
  console.log('User has joined the room', meeting.self.roomJoined);
  // run actions.
});

await meeting.joinRoom();
```

:::

### Leave room

Leave the meeting room.

```js
await meeting.leaveRoom();
```
