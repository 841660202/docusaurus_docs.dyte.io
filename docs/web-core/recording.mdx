# Recording

The `meeting.recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a meeting. You can also get the current status of a recording using this API.

## Recording State
`recordingState` indicates the current recording state of the meeting. The possible states are
- `IDLE`: Meeting is not recording.
- `STARTING`: Meeting recording has been initialized by a user and we are waiting for the recording to start.
- `RECORDING`: Meeting recording is in progress.
- `STOPPING`: Meeting recording has been stopped by a user and we are waiting for the recording to stop.

## Start a recording

To start a recording, you can call the `start` method in the `meeting.recording` object. 

Requirements:
- `recordingState` is in `IDLE` state
- `self.permissions.canRecord` is `true`

```ts
await meeting.recording.start();
```

## Stop a recording

To stop a recording, you can call the `stop` method in the `meeting.recording` object.

Requirements:
- `recordingState` is in `RECORDING` state
- `self.permissions.canRecord` is `true`

```ts
await meeting.recording.stop();
```

## Listening for recording state updates

The meeting.recording object emits events when the recording state changes. You can listen for the recordingUpdate event to log when the recording state changes.
```ts
meeting.recording.on('recordingUpdate', (recordingState) => {
  console.log(recordingState);
});
```
Here, the `recordingState` has the possible types as defined in [Recording State](#recording-state).
