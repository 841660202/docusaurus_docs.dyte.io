  meeting={meeting}
  config={{
    config: {
      // which notifications to show
      notifications: ['chat', 'participant_joined', 'participant_left'],
      // which notifications should have sounds
      notification_sounds: ['chat', 'participant_joined', 'participant_left'],
      // maximum number of participant joined sound notifications
      participant_joined_sound_notification_limit: 10,
      // maximum number of chat message sound notifications
      participant_chat_message_sound_notification_limit: 10,
